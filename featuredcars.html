<h2>Featured Cars:</h2>
<p class="mission2">This month's feature is none other than Spokane, Washington's own Josh M.</p>

<img src="images/IMGP2441grind.png" id="featurecar"/>

<p class="mission2">Josh started in on his 1971 Chevrolet Nova project in 2008. When he got it, the car was just a shell. No engine, no transmission, and a tame 2.75 rear-end. 5 years later, and the pictures speak for themselves.</p>

<p class="mission2">The first thing Josh did: yank the motor. The 350cid V8 that came in the Nova originally might have been good enough for 1971 (and only about 180 horsepower) but it wasn't good enough for Josh. He sourced a low-mileage 454 V8 from a wrecked pick-up truck and went to town. Today, the motor is equipped with Hooker headers, a Holley intake manifold, and a 750cfm four-barrel carburetor. Josh estimates around 400 horsepower at the wheels...and we've no reason to doubt him. One thing is for sure, this '71 has <span class="stress">no</span> problem getting down the road.
</p>

<p class="mission2">After Josh swapped the motor, it was time to beef up the rear end. The Nova came from the factory with a 2.71:1 rear-end. It was great for highway cruising...but not much else. After a little deliberation, Josh decided to swap the old 2.71 rear-end for a 3.56:1 Positraction rear differential from <span class="stress">Jeggs</span> Racing. The "Posi" helps with all the torque the 454 under the hood makes, and the gearing provides a good balance between acceleration and fuel economy (well, as much fuel economy as a tuned 454 can get.)</p>

<p class="mission2">The last step in getting the Nova mechanically sound was a beefed-up TH400 two-speed transmission. Add to that a B and M shift kit and the powertrain in this '71 leaves little to be desired.</p>

<p class="mission2">As for cosmetics, Josh decided to keep the color palette simple and spray the Nova metal-flake silver. The minimalist approach to styling combined with the realtively subtle exhaust note makes this Nova one street-rod to look out for. It may look like a plain-Jane weekender, but rest assured, if bothered, this '71 could leave just about anything in the dust.</p>
